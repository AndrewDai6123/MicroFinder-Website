                    <li>Got two so onto cloning to see how fast that works. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>This was my first M.2 experience. I worried about how to get Windows on to this thing and Googled for advice. Much of the available advice is a couple of years old or more and is already obsolete. I found lots of conflicting advice such as: "Enable CSM", "Don't enable CSM", "Turn off Secure Boot", "Don't turn off Secure Boot", etc. The one constant was that the newer the advice the fewer and simpler were the suggestions offered. Since my ASUS motherboard is reasonably new (oldest BIOS dated 2-23-2018), and since the mobo manual said nothing about tweaking the BIOS for an NVMe drive (It is a pretty skimpy manual), I decided to place my bets on ASUS . If they saw fit not to advise me on using this drive I probably didn't need any such advice. So I installed the newest BIOS file, restored the "Optimized Defaults" (which included an AMI native NVMe driver), stuck in my Windows USB stick, rebooted and let it rip. My faith was well placed. ASUS, Samsung and Windows got together and worked their magic. 10 minutes later I was dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Windows had no trouble finding and using this drive. And I had no trouble at all since I just used the Optimized Defaults. So far I'm loving this drive and I have no problem recommending it. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I heard about the great strides M.2 NVMe expansion cards have made for increasing boot/load and read/write times, and I wasn't disappointed. You won't notice as big of a difference between a normal SATA SSD and an m.2 NVMe card as you would from a regular HDD, but its still pretty noticeable and I would recommend it 100%. Not a con by any means but it is a lil different to install with it being an expansion card (slot), but not difficult by any means. Just make sure your mobo has a compatible m.2 NVMe slot and make sure you don't buy just any m.2 drive make sure its NVMe to get the full value of your money/upgrade. - User from Newegg</li>
