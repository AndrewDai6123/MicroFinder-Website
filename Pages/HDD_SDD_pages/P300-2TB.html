                <ul>
                    <li>This isn't the fastest 3TB HDD, nor does it sport a long warranty. For a budget build, the P300 gives reasonably quick storage. The only comparably priced drives have a 1 year warranty. On the warranty front, I have direct experience with the 2TB version of the P300. It failed after less than 2 months of infrequent (an hour or two a week) use. I'm not dinging the 3TB drive based on my experience with the 2TB variety - just trying to set straight some of the information in earlier reviews. Toshiba's warranty process isn't as painless as Western DIgital/HGST but there certainly are worse (Samsung, here's looking at you). You must have proof of purchase - e.g. a copy of your order receipt email or an invoice downloaded from Newegg's order history. Toshiba is adamant that only the original purchaser can obtain warranty service; most other vendors will simply use the date of manufacture if you do not have proof of purchase. The drive needs to be shipped to Toshiba. After a couple weeks, they send out a replacement. No pre-return replacements or cross shipments here. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li> I have a 1TB version with almost 30,000 hours on it, nary a hiccup. Looking forward to similar drama free performance from this drive. At this point the HDD companies should have this pretty well sorted. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>Toshiba is selling these hard drives for an extremely attractive price. I can recall years ago, when 10K RPM drives were the fastest storage money could buy, paying $1 per GB for a drive that's not even as fast as this one is. These days, I'm tempted to buy an SSD. But even the mediocre performing drives with higher capacities in a good price range aren't really a good value. I would prefer to buy multiple cheap HDDs, like this Toshiba and run them in a RAID array. So I can get the convenience of a large capacity drive, while approaching the sequential speeds you'd see with a standard SSD. All things considered I think these drives are a great value. They come very well packaged, the price to performance ratio is really good and they have a 2 year warranty. I am giving these drives a 4 Egg rating. I don't really have a problem with these drives, but I just don't think they deserve 5 Eggs. - User from Newegg</li>
