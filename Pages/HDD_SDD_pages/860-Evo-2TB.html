                <ul>
                    <li>Now that I have both the 2TB and 4TB Samsung 860 EVO drives are ordered I have no complaints thus far and am satisfied with their performance. The drives are listed under the /AM model number denoting American market drive and therefore US based warranty coverage and support. I ordered a 2TB 860 EVO directly, this came without incident. I ordered a 4TB 860 EVO through one of the Market Place sellers. They shipped me first a OEM drive and then an EU drive, both which have negative warranty implications compared to the 5 year US serviceable warranty advertised on the product page. Basically, while a great drive and I would be again, you really need to be careful about what is advertised vs. what is sent to you. 5 egg product. 1-2 egg buying experience here. I think more should be done to protect the would be purchasers on this site (for example, as I now know, the Market Place seller I bought from has a sub 90% product accuracy rating). - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I recommend this product and will continue to use Samsung SSDs, should a future purchase be necessary again. I didn't feel that I needed the PRO version as my computing is not that high-end. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>The first one is working well. I bought more on the Black Friday promo. I have more devices to upgrade. Notes to those complaining about not being able to register the product on Samsung's website: I contacted Samsung tech support. They said the serial number needed for registering is found on the label on the disk. The serial number on the box is not complete (it's missing a letter at the end). The registration site also needs the "Model Number" but it's not the "Model Number" listed on the drive or box (for mine, MZ-76E500). The "Model Code" is what they actually need, and it is found ONLY on the box (not on the drive). Again, for mine, this was MZ-76E500B/AM. I got an Invalid Model Number error until I tried the Model Code instead. Once I got the right combination, mine was registered. Maybe a bit confusing, and they could be clearer about this. I would not dock an egg or two just because of this. - User from Newegg</li>
