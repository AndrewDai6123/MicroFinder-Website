                <ul>
                    <li>Overall this drive performed very well for a mechanical hard drive while running relatively cool. Itâ€™s good to see that mechanical drives are still improving and finally getting close to the SATA II (3 Gbps) barrier. Considering its low price, this is a great choice if you need a drive with more space than then your SSD. *All tests were conducted three times to ensure accuracy and repeatability of results. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I've had this drive for a few weeks and thus far it's been rock solid. This additional drive compliments the four drives I already have in my FreeNAS deployment. When this disk came in I added another and then dropped that pair in as an additional Mirror pair in my existing mirror stripe for a six disk "Raid10" in other NAS devices. With a total of 8TB of useable space this NAS provides a data dump of storage for my home lab environment. These disks are quiet and do not chew up a large amount of power. They also do not generate a shed load of heat either. Overall a solid purchase. Seagate has cleaned up their act and I won't hesitate to purchase more when the time comes. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>Overall it's a good drive for what it is but at this point the size is somewhat pointless. 500gb while might be nice to have i don't see why the average consumer would be buying it. I would rather have a 64/128gb ssd over a 500gb mechanical drive and the prices are still very similar. - User from Newegg</li>
