                <ul>
                    <li>Overall this drive performed very well for a mechanical hard drive while running relatively cool. It’s good to see that mechanical drives are still improving and finally getting close to the SATA II (3 Gbps) barrier. Considering its low price, this is a great choice if you need a drive with more space than then your SSD. *All tests were conducted three times to ensure accuracy and repeatability of results. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I've had this drive for a few weeks and thus far it's been rock solid. This additional drive compliments the four drives I already have in my FreeNAS deployment. When this disk came in I added another and then dropped that pair in as an additional Mirror pair in my existing mirror stripe for a six disk "Raid10" in other NAS devices. With a total of 8TB of useable space this NAS provides a data dump of storage for my home lab environment. These disks are quiet and do not chew up a large amount of power. They also do not generate a shed load of heat either. Overall a solid purchase. Seagate has cleaned up their act and I won't hesitate to purchase more when the time comes. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>Overall it's a good drive for what it is but at this point the size is somewhat pointless. 500gb while might be nice to have i don't see why the average consumer would be buying it. I would rather have a 64/128gb ssd over a 500gb mechanical drive and the prices are still very similar. - User from Newegg</li>
