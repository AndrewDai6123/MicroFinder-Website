            <h1>About us</h1>

            <p>
            <br><br> This website was created by a team of independent computer scientists. 
            <br><br> Our names are Andrew Dai, Jason McHenry, David Delgado, and Eric Lopez. 
            <br><br> Our goal for this website is for it to be a one stop website that fulfills all of your personal computer needs.
            No longer will you need to go to numerous websites to find all of your PC parts and information, since it will all be here.
            Moreso, if you are a complete beginner, we have got that handled too. 
            We'll break down what each of the key components that make up a personalized
            computer does, making your life much simpler. 
            Especially since building a PC for the first time can be a bit daunting given that
            there is so much to know about. 
            <br><br> We hope you like our website and please consider supporting us. If you have any questions or
            inquiries, please contact us at support@microFinder.com.
