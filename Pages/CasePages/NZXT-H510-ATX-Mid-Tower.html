                <ul>
                    <li>I had upgraded my tower from yesteryear model to NZXT H510. I must say that this is very convenient to access anything on the motherboard as the SSDs, HDDs and PSU(SMPS) are tucked away to the other side (in the bottom cage). Co-incidentally everything I have including, motherboard, heatsink, RAM, Graphics Cards are all Black/Red. So this case aesthetically pleasing. Without water cooling and a fairly high degree of overclocking the CPU, the temperatures are still don't go over 70 degrees, very well thought out airflow and impressively designed chassis with plenty of vents. - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>My 13 year old son was building his first PC and this was the case he chose. He did all the research and figured out the NZXT - H510 would be suitable for his project. It is very well built and solid, the tempered glass is cool so you can see what’s inside. - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>I recently chose this case for my build. Worked well with my build and didn't have any problems. Only problem was taking off the front glass panel, but that was easy fixed by pushing out the panel from the inside. Just take off the back cover and push it from the inside. Other than that 5/5. - User from Best Buy</li>
