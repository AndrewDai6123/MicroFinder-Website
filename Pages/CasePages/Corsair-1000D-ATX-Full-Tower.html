                <ul>
                    <li>This is a great case i had the 570x and upgraded to this mainly fot the doors that open which makes doing anything inside easy to do being upgrades or just a clean.Yes theres cheaper cases out there but if you look at the cost of a pack of 3 ll120 fans and a commander pro it makes the case a good price in total.Very easy to work in and fit your bits long as you do good cables in the back all should be fine.The glass lifts off with 1 screw to undo so its easy to clean and looks great with the lights.The ll lights mainly put light out not into the case so if you wanted the full rgb led both ways it might be better to upgrade the fans to the newer ql models.All in all i think it is a worthwhile look at if your looking for a new build case yes you pay a little more but corsair are great with the warrenty if it needed to be used within the 2 year time.Going to get a 1000d next now they are on offer as it will take e a lot more drives. No 5.25 bay for a dvd writer but external ones are cheap enough these days and this has the more modem look . - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>The case is excellent. It has a recess to hide all the drives and some neat cable management options. The magnetically closed glass sides are fantastic to use. However the built in fan controller is dreadful. I have not been able to gain any control over their speed - it randomly turns them all up full which is very noisy and the colours of the RGB fans sometimes its on, off, a colour profile I didn't select. Its ruined my ability to make my Lux keyboard look how I want. Had I known this was going to be so bad, I would have bought a different case. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I purchased the Corsair Obsidian 500D to rehouse my current system from it's original case (stock Asus from Best Buy). I love my Asus computer, but after four years, it's time to begin updating. Since I'm building on a budget, I wanted to start with the case so that I would have all the room I needed for future upgrades. This case is large and has plenty more space than I will ever need for a home build. This case is solid and looks great. I would suggest some lighted fans and LED light strips if you really want to show off your components. The glass doors are sturdy and they can be easily removed while building. Mounting fans is easy and the dust filters are great for homes with pets! The back panel also allows for easy vertical mounting of your graphics card. I really like the HDD and SDD holders on the back side, however I could not install my current HDD because the cables because they would stick out a bit and prevent the glass panel from closing. However, this is a not a fault of the case and it will not be an when I install a new drive/cables in the future. Because there is so much room in this case, I had no trouble relocating my old HDD to unused space. I am look forward to upgrading and doing more with this case. I would like to address some of the concerns that I have read in other reviews. I had no difficulty removing screws for the fan plates or cable covers. I suspect that if anyone had trouble with these screws, they simply did not realign the covers properly. The PSU box has lots of space to hide your cables and a vertical cover on the back side allows you to hide cables running up to the front power panel, hard drives, or to the other side of the case. There are also a number of places to attach zip ties for easy organization. I saw one review that gave this case a lower rating because a disk drive could not be mounted. If that is important to you, then you probably should look for another case. I rarely use a disk drive myself, and you can always purchase a USB connected drive if you need one. - User from Amazon</li>
