                <h1>Reviews from Customers</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ok so I read the reviews, watched the videos of all this concern with thermal problems in this case due to the front glass. From the get go I wanted to put an All in one (AIO) CPU cooler in my build. So that's what I did. The case itself I feel is built really well. Very easy to work with, allows for some great cable management. I didn't have so much of an issue with it not having drive trays, and yes I agree it's a little in inconvenient to have to unscrew the entire disk tray to install the drives but hey it's not like I plan on swapping drives everyday so get over it. About my only gripe with the case itself is the fact that NZXT and pretty much everyone else can't just come up with a standard RGB plan to make them all universal. I went with a different brand AIO so I can't get it to sync with the NZXT, nor can I get my RGB Fusion 2.0 stuff to sync because they don't in tandem with each other. So I'm stuck with 3 different brands of various RGB in this build. Did it come out looking fantastic, IMO, yes. So for me at least the build was just fine, everything worked as it should. The price is a bit steep for a case but you are getting 2 140mm RGB fans with that and a rear 120 non RGB fan along with the NZXT RGB controller. So of you decided to go all NZXT for your RGB, you are fine. As far as thermals go, even with the AIO on the CPU, I wasn't happy with how warm the case was inside, so my solution was adding a thermo probe inside the case, and changing the temperature curves accordingly. This was built as a gaming rig, so the CPU doesn't get as beat up as the GPU does, so I added another thermo probe to (as close as I could get it) my GPUs processor and reset the temperature curves on the rear and upper case fans accordingly to go along with the temps of that thermo probe. In all of my stress tests, the case never got above 60c (23c ambient), the CPU never went higher then 76c and the GPU never went higher then 73c, all of this after a 1 hour stress test. Had this been an all air cooled system, I'm sure I would have had an issue. But for me I did not. Overall, I would recommend this case if you plan on using the fans and like NZXTs software for the RGB, but if you plan on doing your own RGB, don't go for the Elite. Hope this review has helped someone. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>This is my first ever review on amazon and I’ve been a prime member for YEARS, but I had to review this case. This case is the upgraded version from the H500 from my understanding. I purchased the H510 (White) and it is simply amazing. The “i” version provides RGB technology but you may already have enough RGB lighting that you don’t need to spend the extra money. The H510 has supreme cable management over other cases and a tempered glass side panel to show off your sleek hardware. As for temperatures, my Ryzen 7 2700x stays at around 36-40 Degrees Celsius at 0% load , AMD XFX 580 at around 46-50 Degree Celsius at 0% load (AMD runs hotter). Some might say that the airflow is questionable due to the fact that the front is covered by steel but air is taken from side of case. I have not had any problems thus far with temperatures even at 100% load. The case comes with 2 additional chassis fans and room for two fans in the front or a 280 mm CPU water cooler such as kraken 62. The case also comes with additional standoffs, screws and zip ties. I would recommend using a fully modular PSU to benefit from the cable management this case has to offer. Overall 5/5 and this is my first NZXT product. Goodbye Thermaltake. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I should have paid attention to reviews before buying this case. The two included fans aren't nearly enough to cool everything and putting two more fans in the front of the case changes the temps very little because there's not much airflow from the solid front panel side of the case. I don't know if there would be enough cool air drawn through to use a front radiator cooler in this case. Your mileage will vary depending on the quality of the fans used I guess. The vent on top is only 120mm so you won't be able to mount a 240mm radiator cooler and a 120 mm cooler would have to be really thin in order to clear the motherboard because it's mounted so high up in the case. The fan barely clears it as it is. I don't know if there are any radiator coolers that thin that will fit. Maybe NZXT makes one. I haven't looked. I replaced both stock fans with ones that have better airflow rating and added two more of the same fans up front because they are RBG and I like bling. Even though you can't see the front RGB fans from the front side of the case they do look nice when viewing through the glass side panel. Cable management was a breeze. The SSD caddies are cheap plastic and kinda flimsy but should work fine as long as you're not in the habit of changing out hard drives all of the time. I was even able to make a nice looking backside with cable management channels and cable ties in all of the right places. There are no sharp edges. This was the first case I've used in quite a while that didn't draw blood when building in it. There is no window that shows the power supply which is nice too because usually the specifications label is on the side that you can see and it's ugly and needs to come off. This case hides the entire power supply so you don't have to worry about it. If your power supply has a RGB fan there are holes on top of the enclosure that will allow you to see it still. The case is nice to look at. If only it had better front air intake I would give it more stars. You can find various videos on YouTube where the presenter is talking about this issue. A mesh front panel is all it needs to make this a great case. If I had to do it all over again I probably wouldn't buy this case but with much effort I was finally able to get the temps down to an acceptable level though I know if I had a better case it would be much cooler as I have a friend with an identical build in a different case and his temps are cooler than mine. - User from Amazon</li>
