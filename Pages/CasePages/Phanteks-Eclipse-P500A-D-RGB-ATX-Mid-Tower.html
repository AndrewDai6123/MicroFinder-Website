                <ul>
                    <li>The reviews on YouTube for this case persuaded me to try it and they were right. It's a fantastic case, loads of room for building in, and fantastic airflow. I didn't use the supplied fans as i wanted to use an AIO and my own RGB Corsair fans, so there's no point in me commenting on noise. I'd definitely have another of these without hesitation. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Simply beautiful case. I found it really quite easy to build in thanks to its large capacity. Not having a full size tower for years, the built in hidden cable management is a godsend for the amateur PC builder. I just wish 30X0 series GPUs weren't so rare (at RRP, not paying some scalper) or I would have gotten that in white also! I got an additional exhaust fan also from phanteks, as well as the cpu cooler. All together it's quiet and keeps it's insides lovely and cool, looks great and is very sturdy. Can't fault it! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Bought this set because they were ball-end then I get them and the two sizes I use the most aren't ball-end. Sure, the small sizes will break easily if they are ball-end but I wish they had let me decide how to use them instead of deciding for me. Sure, it kind of notes that the small sizes aren't ballend in the bullet points but the title says "8 Balldriver and Hex" while perhaps it should say "5 Balldriver and 3 Hex". Basically a waste of money for me since I already had hex t-handles in those sizes. I bought this set to get ball-end. - User from Amazon</li>
