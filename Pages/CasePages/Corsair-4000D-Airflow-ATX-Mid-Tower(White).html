                <ul>
                    <li>I saw this case at the last moment before I ordered a Nzxt 710 for my new pc build and for the $80 usd price I decided I'd give it a try as I have had the 710 before and this was much cheaper. The overall build quality is really good and I was a little surprised. The reason I have given it a 4 star is for 3 reasons combined. 1- the thumb screws holding the two side panels on are not the best quality but in all intents and purposes they keep the side panels on so not the worst. 2- this reason is most likely why the thumb screws are a little...screwy...lol. but the side pannels are a bit stiff and you have to make sure you line them up exactly and can be hard to put back on correctly. 3- this might be a little nit picky but I really wish they would have included a 3rd fan but you can always get another one later. Overall for the $80-100 usd this case is for sure a great buy and i would recommend 10/10 times. I have built in a lot of cases and the cable management routes in the back are amazing and why I liked the NZXT h710 but for $60 usd cheaper I have to recommend this case. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Seems nice and solid. Standoffs were already lined up just right for my AMD B450 motherboard. Lots of airflow openings (pretty much the whole thing is openings, except the two big square sides). The four screw holes for the power supply are just a hair off from the holes in my Corsair RM650, so the last one was a little tricky to get in. I'd advise a little filing with a round-section file before putting your hardware in, to make the holes line up correctly. Lots of room for additional drives if I decide to add some (currently just running a M.2 SSD card). NOTE: the accessory box is not missing, it's tucked into one of the SATA drawers, accessible by removing the panel on the motherboard side. Good thing I decided to take that off, because the response to my simple "where are the screws" question from Corsair support was just a form email about returning the case. Not very helpful. ALSO NOTE: this case has a connector for a micro-USB, and the B450 board doesn't have a place to connect it. The normal USB is fine for me, but this slight incompatibility may bother some people. I just have the micro-USB wire tucked out of the way. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Corsair 5000D Airflow black. this case is great has plenty of space for whatever you want to install in this case. Have 6 sp120rgb fans on the front and side one sp120rgb rear and h150 capellix 360 aio on the top.gpu and CPU temps are in good range with this setup very happy. Back of the case you can fit all fan controllers that come with corsair aio and rgb products and all of your psu cables so space is plenty. Keep in mind the black model has pretty dark tint on the glass panel so if you want crystal clear view of your components get the white model. love the classic box shape of this case simple but very elegant. - User from Amazon</li>
