                <ul>
                    <li>I was looking for budget priced case that offered good ventilation and various cooling options because I'm running a Ryzen 3800X. It had to have a clean design, front mesh for fan intake and, I also wanted LED fans. That being said, I opted for this case and I purchased an additional set (6 pack with controller) of Apevia 120mm Frostblade fans to add two additional fans to the top of the case. The additional fans were not a direct connect to the 4 fans that came installed in the case. So, I removed those and installed the 6 new fans with controller. This made for a cleaner installation and wire management for the fans. I recommend using a modular power supply and having all cables attached prior to mounting. Once installed, you can not add cables to power supply. With my old case, my processor temp was 37-38 degrees C at idle. With this case and additional fans, I'm at 33-34 degrees C at idle. I'm very pleased with this case. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>My first time building my own PC and I got this BEAUTIFUL pink case! This thing is everything I could have ever asked for- and more. The pink is breathtaking and gorgeous. I was going to paint it when it got here but when I opened it up I decided it is perfect as is!!! It did have damage to the side when I opened it, sadly. Nothing ruined inside of it as I can tell yet but nonetheless, without the small damage it is absolutely perfect and high quality! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>It’s a great case and looks amazing when it’s all finished and built in!! The only thing is it’s a hard to build in! Not impossible, but definitely a mission, well worth it if you want a challenge! I am so pleased it was worth the stress of building in it! - User from Amazon</li>
