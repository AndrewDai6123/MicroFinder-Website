                <ul>
                    <li>I picked this up as a replacement for my primary display. It's exactly what I wanted -- 1080p, IPS panel, and high refresh rate -- and came without any damage or other defects. Fantastic all-around product at a great price. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I'd say without the dead pixel this is obviously a 5* as of reception day. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>This was to replace a ASUS VG248QE 24" Full HD 1920 x 1080 1ms (GTG) 144Hz. Wife wanted a monitor that had accurate color and contrast for her graphic design work, and also be able to play games. Her work was more important so I went with this IPS. Was worried about how it would look at 144Hz being an IPS, but I was impressed. There was no change in quality. My old monitor would get washed out (too much gamma) when going to 144Hz. This is a very new review being the first day testing it, but so far we're both really happy with it. Would recommend. Well worth the buy. - User from Newegg</li>
