                <ul>
                    <li>Uses the exact same panel as the legendary LG 27GL850 but without the USB hub making it $50 cheaper! The 27GL850 is easily one of the best, if not the best, 27" 1440p gaming panel. It matches or exceeds other monitors in clarity of motion (grey to grey response times) and color accuracy at a sub $500 price level (the Viewsonic Elite XG270QG, ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ, and Gigabyte Aorus FI27Q-P are all $600 or more at the time of this review - and shamefully that Gigabyte model is the third of a product line that didn't actually add DisplayPort 1.4 until that Q-P model). Anyone looking for a premium gaming monitor should look no further as not only is it the best panel, it's at the best price by far. Still can't believe I got this at $449 when the actual 27GL850 (last year's model) is extremely hard to find and going for upward of $600 as well. If I had the extra money, I would buy two more of these. - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>I like everything about this monitor, picture quality, all the specs, etc, EXCEPT its stand is really bulky and long in the back. If you have a big single level desk then no worries, but I have a second shelf level on my desk and, since the stand is so bulky and long, I couldn't fit it on the main level. Way too close to my face and was pushing into my keyboard and mouse area. I had to put it on the shelf level and put the monitor down as low as it will go, which is still a little high and I have to look up a bit for. Might have to cut my shelf in half, still figuring out what I want to do. It feels unnecessary too, like there's just empty space in the stand so it's excess length and bulk is purely cosmetic and not functional. Other than that, performance wise it's great. - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>One of the best monitors I ever used.  Going from 1080p to 1440p makes a world of difference.  From 70hz to 144hz is like night and day too.  With gsync I get no screen tearing.  Works wonders with rtx3070 graphics card. - User from Best Buy</li>
