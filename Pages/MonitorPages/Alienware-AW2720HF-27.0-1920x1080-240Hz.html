                    <li class = "work"><strong>Features</strong></li>
                    <li class = "please">- A 240Hz refresh rate is 4x faster than typical standard monitors and twice as fast as common 120Hz gaming monitors. More frames means smaller visual information Gaps, which means a faster reaction time for the Gamer. There's a 8.3 millisecond gap between frames at 120Hz, which is halved to 4.16ms between frames at 240Hz. This is incredibly important to gamers playing at breakneck speeds, and provides an edge over gamers less well-equipped. Combined with skill, get more wins by being able to react in real-time.</li>
                    <li class = "please">- Amd Radeon free Sync technology synchronizes the GPU and monitor, displaying full frames only when the monitor is capable of displaying them. This minimizes graphic distortions such as tearing and artifacts from forming on screen, allowing you to experience native refresh rates up to 240Hz for rapid-fire, tear-free Graphics that don't require user adjustments.</li>
                    <li class = "please">- A wide-angle viewing range means that color coverage is consistent no matter which angle The screen is viewed from. This is thanks to the IPS technology that the monitor is built on.</li>
                    <li class = "please">- Convenient monitor controls are easily reached on the right side of the monitor, with a new joystick for navigating menus quickly and intuitively. The individual buttons can be assigned as shortcuts for the gamer's preferred tools and settings.</li>
                    <li class = "please">- The true 1ms response time blasts away motion blur. The pixels are able to change quickly and respond to the new image signal as it comes in. This is a new feature for IPS monitors, which have typically been considered too slow for gaming.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Is this monitor objectively "good"? Let me say yes. The quality was fantastic. And the item came perfectly intact with no issues. 240 hertz IPS is a relatively slim selection at this point in time. I come from a Dell 144 Hertz g-sync 1440p monitor. I really wanted something with much higher refresh rate for the shooters that I play. but what I realized after extensive use of my 1440p is that no matter how great the monitor is, going down to 1080p for me personally just gave up way too much visual quality. so my complaint is not really with the monitor itself since it works exactly as designed has great colors and is buttery smooth. I got back some of the quality by increasing the resolution scale in certain games and adding a little bit of sharpening but at that point you are using the same amount of vram as you were on a 1440 screen, yet you are sacrificing pixels per inch. So then at that point why have the monitor? as I said this is a fantastic piece of equipment just know why you are buying it before trying it out. hopefully by mid 2019 we have some 240 hertz 1440p IPS displays to choose from and I will definitely snag one. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I went from a 1440p GSynch monitor to this sure it’s only 1080p but you haven’t really gamed until you played on a 240Hz monitor. Alienware/Dell knocked this out of the park with the quality. No regrets purchasing this monitor! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Basically the same panel as the acer nitro xv273x, but 150 dollars cheaper. You can’t beat this price on an IPS 240hz monitor, best deal on the market right now, i highly recommend this to anyone that has a gtx 1080 ti or above, you need the right system to enjoy this monitor at its full potential. The color reproduction is night and day compared to a TN panel, and it has minimal blur. - User from Amazon</li>
