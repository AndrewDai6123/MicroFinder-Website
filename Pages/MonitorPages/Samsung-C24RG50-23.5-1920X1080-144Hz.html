                    <li>I have had no issues with this monitor. This is coming from someone who despises Samsung...I have a 4k TV from Samsung and I have always regretted the purchase. I was VERY skeptical and did a lot of research before buying this, especially considering the cost. I was surprised at how wonderful it has been so far. The limitations of the monitor are usually only due to the GPU or the settings you've set up. The menu interface on the monitor is intuitive and straightforward. I have live wallpaper set up and it's a beautiful sight and very relaxing after a long day of work. The only "con" I would say, is that the mount doesn't rise very far. Other than that it really is a spectacular sight. I have been impressed and EXTREMELY relieved considering the financial investment. I've done a bit of gaming on it and also have no complaints there. I have no doubt that some of these ship with some faulty hardware, and that would be an insane letdown...I feel for those who've been that unfortunate. The only problem I have with the purchase itself was the late shipping, courtesy of UPS. But it is that time of year, so I just let it go. If you are considering this product, I'd order it from a good vendor and just hope for the best that you don't get one that has a defective part. It really is pretty spectacular. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I love the screen size and the picture is great. I have an issue if my PC goes to sleep tho, after waking up the screen comes on for a few seconds and goes black again. Power cycling the screen fixes this however in order to power cycle you need to open the menu that won't open if the screen thinks there's no signal. So the only way is to reboot pc or unplug and plug the screen back in. The built in software that runs the menu controls is unreliable at best which is unacceptable for a premium product like this. I'm still giving 4 eggs because of how much I like the picture and I've found work arounds for my issues. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>This replaced two AOC 21:9 monitors, and even though 32:9 isn't quite 42:9, it's still an improvement because there's no bezel, everything is calibrated the same because it's two screens on a single panel, and there's a single power cable where I used to have two. I had some strong reservations about the fact that this was curved (I've steadfastly refused to buy anything curved up to this point, in this case it wasn't a choice as much as a lack of options). The curved display DOES take some getting used to at first, but after a few days you don't even notice it, and in some ways the curved surface actually seems better suited to the super-ultrawide aspect ratio. I wouldn't want curved displays for everything (I have a laptop and a TV in the same room, both flat, and they work just fine even with a curved display in the mix), but for this 32:9 display it actually works very well. If you've been considering a curved monitor but have reservations, this is the advice I can offer: if you're sitting very close to your monitor and/or it's 21:9 or wider, make it a curved one; if you sit far away or just have a 16:9 display, I don't think it would be worth investing just to have one. Pay attention to the usual specs about colors and brightness and refresh rates first, since those are what really count, but don't be scared off if the only ones you can find are curved. - User from Newegg</li>
