                    <li>I purchased this monitor in preparation for the release of the PS5. Initially, I couldn't seem to find a way for it to output in 120 hz. After a little trial and error, I found the solution. Here is how to output in 120 hz, just keep in mind that not all games currently on the PS5 are 120 hz capable. Go to SETTING-SAVED DATA AND GAME/APP SETTINGS-GAME PRESETS- and change the setting to PERFORMANCE MODE. After doing this COD Cold War was output at 1080p 120 hz. Overall, this moniter does the trick for now. At 1 ms response time you can ask for more, except for 4k at 120 hz. This will hold me over for now. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>This monitor was recommended by a Youtube geek channel but it was horrible! I bought a new Cyberpower PC which was a dream to start & needed a new monitor to go with it. I've spent two days trying to get the text right on this monitor (some letters were half dark/half light, text blurry, etc.) Read it was Windows 10 problem and tried everything on that end. My old PC had Windows 7 but I have Windows 10 on my laptop and it never looked this bad!! Tried Nvidia controls. Did not fix. Controls under front of monitor were awkward as hell to use - took two fingers. That did not work. No manual was included. Got on phone with Amazon techs this morning (what a joke!) and what they told me did not fix it. I went to Costco later today and saw an LG monitor for about $15. more than I paid for this one and it's a 27". Started right up, changed the resolution and voila - no fuzzy text!!! This is a monitor for someone who has days to mess around trying to get resolution right. I'm a gamer and I also work on my computer so needed something that could do both. I'm not a technical genius but never had this problem in setting up a computer and monitor before. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I really enjoyed this monitor while I had it, but I had to return it just in case the one issue I had was caused by a faulty unit. The VA panel is vibrant with excellent contrast. It suffered from VA glow like most do, and while I've become accustomed to it with my Samsung TV, it did distract me in darker games like Metro 2033. Speaking of, while the contrast added depth to dark scenes, fast movement caused blurriness and trailing. It's not 90s-era LCD levels of horrible, but it's there. If you value image richness over motion clarity, you'll be happy. This was my first 144hz monitor, and it won't be my last. Gaming over 100fps was a revelation. Coming from an old 22" 1080p 60hz IPS monitor, I didn't realize it was that much of a performance bottleneck. Now that I'm back on that 22" monitor, I do. This was also my first FreeSync monitor, and it was the reason I had to return the display. I bought this monitor after NVIDIA released their drivers enabling G-Sync for FreeSync monitors. On the surface, it works. Over 80fps, it's perfect. However, my monitor suffered from significant brightness flickering. This was not the same as the occasional black frame barging into the scene. It was more akin to gaming by candlelight; the screen's brightness would flicker rapidly in certain situations. Anything locked at 60fps (game menus, games with a fixed frame rate, etc.) were the worst offenders, but I experienced this issue in games that sat in the 50-80fps range. I returned this monitor after consulting AOC customer support. Hopefully this is not an issue for anyone else, but if it is, I have since found some posts online describing a similar problem with other VA FreeSync monitors and possible ways to fix it. Best of luck to you. If you want an affordable 1080p 144hz display and you loathe the thought of having to sit absolutely dead center in front of a TN panel to get a reasonable image, then you will probably like this monitor. Just beware of possible FreeSync issues. - User from Amazon</li>
