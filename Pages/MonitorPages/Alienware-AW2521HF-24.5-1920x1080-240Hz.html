                <ul>
                    <li>This is the first monitor I have ever played on with a 240hz refresh rate, so that being said I do not have any previous experience to compare with. I went from a 32inch 2k 75hz monitor and I was a bit worried leaving behind the higher resolution. Due to the smaller screen size this was not much of an issue. There is a difference, but due to the pixel density of my previous monitor, it isn’t missed. I was also concerned of the smaller monitor size. This was an issue for about an hour of gaming, then just faded away into the glorious response time and refresh rate of this monitor. I mostly play Apex, MW, Valorant, CSGO and a bit of Overwatch. Seriously has been a game changer. I can run all these games at around 200fps and above and I have seen significant increase in my gaming ability due to this monitor. Tracking has never been easier. Colors were fairly accurate under my custom setting and I used a calibration tool to get it right where it needed to be, but most might be pretty happy with just a few tweaks if you aren’t doing anything more than gaming and media consumption. Every monitor is different in that sense, so your most color accurate setting could be different with your monitor. I have not noticed any ghosting and my monitor came without any dead pixels. I was able to snag it at $315, if you’re able to find it below $400-go for it. Again, This is coming from a person who had never played on a 240hz monitor before. I may not be the best person to make a purchase decision from, but from the many reviews I had read and watched prior to my purchase, most have had similar feelings about this monitor. I am very happy with my purchase so far. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Surprised this does not have ulmb, almost returned it... But with Gsync and 237fps capped, this works better than ULMB! Highly recommend! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I got this monitor to go with my new iBUYPOWER desktop. And when I received this monitor, I was impressed! The packaging is amazing! Everything is nicely packed and secured. Not only that, the quality of the monitor is outstanding too! It’s nicely built and very easy to put together. I really liked the color too, it’s a matte space gray which is fingerprint proof. The display also has a matte finish, which will get rid of glare and reduce fingerprints. Also, since it’s an IPS panel the viewing angles aren’t affected like the TN Panel, everything is still nice and bright. The 240 hz and 1 ms response time feels and looks the best. I highly recommend this monitor in every applicable way. Best monitor out there and it’s at an amazing price too! - User from Amazon</li>
