                <ul>
                    <li>Awesome quality. I had been looking for an IPS moitor for 3 week straight and none of them fully fill my requirements. I am an IT student so I spend a lot of time looking at my monitors. I need an IPS panel for better view angle and vesa ready for portrait mode when I need to code. I occasionally play game ( PUBG) so I want a monitor with Flicker-free feature and AMD freesync. I've through literally a hundred of different monitors and none of them fit my needs. This one totally satisfies all my requirements and has a sleek appearance with very thin bezel. There were barely any reviews and I took a gamble buying two of these. Best decision ever!!!!! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I got this monitor for my son who games. We are on a budget. This is a step up from the same one we got at Costco, I figured this new one would be his main gaming screen. I was wrong, he uses it for discord and YouTube as his 2nd. You can definitely tell the difference. If your playing simple games and Minecraft this is great! Other higher quality games and PVP this might be a little disappointing for you. I’m the mom and too me it looks 100%, my 16 year old gaming son would give it a 6 out of 10. He will continue to use it as a 3rd monitor when he saves up for his main screen in the future. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I originally purchased a New Acer SB220Q IPS 21.5" Zero Frame Monitor. I purchased it based on the many reviews and was also ranked #1 in Best sellers in Amazon. The Acer Monitor picture quality at the time seemed great and the monitor itself was thin but I started having intermittent screen issues with it. I was desperately looking for a replacement during the next 2 days reading reviews on similar priced monitors. I just could not find anything else that appealed to me and I didn't want to take a chance on replacing with the same model Acer. Then I found this LG 24MK600M-B 24 Inch Full HD Monitor. Regular price on it was way over my returned monitor Amazon credit but I saw one that was only $13 dollars more at $108 but said was in "Used Very Good" condition. It had only one review to go by and after reading all the features, its 24" and checking LG's Website I took a chance. The monitor arrived and was actually still Brand New and only the retail box had some storage damage on one corner. This was why it was described "Used Very Good" on the condition. I don't care the box is getting thrown out anyway. Once I hooked up the monitor and turned it on I immediately saw a quality difference in the picture over the Acer. More detail, the colors were more accurate and text was not grainy as was on the Acer. This was before I even calibrated it! Once calibrated it is now better than I ever hoped it would be. I Love it and I'm also getting a nice jump in screen size from 21.5" to a 24". This makes all the difference for me as my vision isn't as great as it used to be. I definitely would recommend this monitor to others. The monitor is exactly 24" measured diagonally not including the bezel. Someone posted a negative comment that it was 20" which it is not. - User from Amazon</li>
