                <ul>
                    <li>I wish someone would have been as clear as I’m about to be when I was looking up reviews. Just got it today and it’s amazing. I have a ps5 and I did endless research to find the right monitor that could run 120hz through the hdmi, and I can confirm this monitor does exactly that. Just make sure you turn OFF free sync and turn ON resolution performance to get 120fps. GAME ON my brothers and sisters. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>So to start off, I got on my Girlfriend's Amazon account just to write this review because I was so pleased with this product (I ordered the monitor on her account since she has Prime). Let me just say wow, the difference in performance I got from this monitor from a 144hz monitor to a 280 hz was tremendous, to the point 144hz appears choppy to me. Obviously this machine is gonna require some pretty par hardware to achieve 280 fps consistently, but man if you reach it , its insane. For background, when I played OW competitively, I was t500 multiple seasons, Global Elite on CSGO, and am right now Diamond 2 in Valorant (still on that grind baby). You immediately notice non-existent screen tearing, the ability to perfectly track even during fast motions such a Jett dash, Genji dash etc.. Trust me, if you play games very competitively, this is your monitor and for a really good price. Can't get past the 1080p on the monitor for the price? Its ok the 24.5 In version keeps the pixels pretty tight so you don't have to worry about pixelated images and you'll be fast af boi. If you are upgrading from 240Hz to this though, I do not reccomend buying this product, I'd say wait until the 360hz monitor comes out since that will too be a huge leap. Best of luck Gamers, I had to write this review because I didn't see enough of them for this beauty, peace. :) - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>1080p TN is relevant in 2021, and after experiencing this monitor it rustles my jimmies to hear reviewers trying to tell me that no one has the excuse to still be buying a TN these days. If you've done your research like me, every competitor that is TN, IPS, or 1440p has too many deal breaking quirks that dissuaded me from buying one (until this one came along). Things like some reviewers telling you that Zowie's Dyac+ looks amazing, but then look deeper and you find comments about dyac introducing awful shadow ghosting and that no pro actually uses it, plus the worse colors. Or how 360hz have a great deal of overshoot and blur, and how the most modern IPS still aren't up to speed with TN.Well, I gambled on buying this one before any reviews were out on the hopes that the TN panel would fix every gripe about the IPS version and that this would become the new royalty for response time and clarity, and so far it's safe to say it paid off! If there's anything else wrong with it that we discover in the near future, I still feel great for the low price that I paid for it. Because you get SO much speed, visability, and motion clarity for this price. If you want a new game slaying monitor that doesn't break the bank, you've found it. - User from Newegg</li>
