                    <li>There wasn't going to be any question as to whether or not the pair of 4gb Kingston Hyper X "Fury" dimms were going to work out since I knew htey would since I run Kingston primarily on every custom build since it's an excellent brand. The 8gb replaces the pair of Mushkin Enhanced memory that was simply borrowed and blue when an old case saw a problem with that brand and the pair were available for use temporarily on a new secondary system being spare parts laying around. The old case however has since seen a new board and supply will now see those two go in with the other pair of same to see 8gb there while the second case finally saw the desired memory installed. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Did what it was supposed to. Windows 10 is now do-able on an old machine. I like how the listing had a feature to check compatibility. Played well with my other memory modules until I decided to buy more of this one to max out the pc. Now my PC has got 99 problems but low memory isn't one of them. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Perfect pairing and OC with Ryzen 1600. - User from Newegg</li>
