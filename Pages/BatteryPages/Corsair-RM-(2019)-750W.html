                <ul>
                    <li>I upgraded my video card and was told I would have to upgrade my power supply also. I've done both once before so I thought what the heck I can do this! it wasn't that easy! the video card was not an issue but the power supply, Yikes! it came with a bag full of assorted wires you MAY need for different set ups. I was overwhelmed and at first thought this was way over my head! I didn't know where to plug the wires into the power supply. anyways I took a breath a read the instructions many times over and was able to figure it out. was it worth it! Hell Yeah! my picture quality is excellent now! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>This unit is fully modular was is great but the cables are really stiff for some reason. I spent a lot of time trying to manage the cables to make sure the stiffness wasn't putting unnecessary stress on the motherboard headers. The 24 pin power cable is so rigid that when I tried to bend it, it felt like it could snap. This PSU is not ideal if you hope to achieve a very clean look with your cables. I'm using it in a Fractal Meshify C and it barely fits, if it was any larger it wouldn't slide into place. The Meshify C is pretty compact so I would not recommend this PSU in that case, I'd recommend looking for something smaller. This is more of a case issue but just making a note about the compatibility. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I came home from work as usual and turned on the PC I built in Sept 2018. There have been no problems until today. I smelled that burning plastic smell - just a hint - so I shut down, unplugged from the wall immediately and assessed. Nothing seemed odd. The smell was gone. Nothing seemed melted or burnt. I cautiously turned on the pc again and the power supply lit the cord plugging into it on fire and made this zappy sound very similar to an electric ladder. I pulled the wall and it quickly burnt out. Could have been worse. No idea if it damaged the other components. Then I did further investigation. The PSU melted the power cable! Lesson: only use the super thick power cord that comes with the psu. The smaller power cables you have lying around can’t handle the draw. - User from Amazon</li>
