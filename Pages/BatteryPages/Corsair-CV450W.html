                <ul>
                    <li>I built my son a computer, with an eye towards noise abatement. I picked this power supply because it said something about PWM fan that is on demand and quieter. Worked great until a few days later that fan got kicked up to high and then it started making a clicking noise. I opened the computer, checked all my wires and fans, but it was the fan inside this power supply. Must've got a bad one. No worries, ordered a direct replacement. Amazon and seller quickly supplied me with #2. 2 days later, high speed loud and obvious clicking that sent my son back to get me again. At this point, I spent a little more for av EVGA 650W unit, which I just finished installing, the third time I have installed and wired this computer's power supply. I can't believe that this company would consider the noises these units make at high speed normal, so it must be their quality control. Either way, unless you are prepared to live with the racket or re-wire your computer 3x, I would pass on this power supply. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I performed a power supply test on the power supply, and it took a few tries to get it to work. It turns out that you really need to push the power cord connector as hard as you can into the power supply. The metal contact is about 70% in the socket, so if you only plug it in normally, there is no metal-metal contact. The connectors are a little painful to plug into the motherboard. You also have to jam them in very hard since some of the contacts for the plugs are not at the same position. The power cable for SATA should also have the connectors pointing at different sides so that it does not need to be extremely and roughly twisted just to get them into the SATA devices. It took a while for me to figure out why I was not getting any power to the motherboard, but eventually after examining every component of the power supply, I figured out that I wasn't jamming the cables hard enough to get some contact. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Works well! Reliable, continuous power delivery. Using it in Phanteks - ECLIPSE P400 TEMPERED GLASS ATX Mid Tower Case. Parts are Ryzen 5 1600 , msi rx 580 4 gb armor oc, 5 upHere rgb fans with hub and controller, led rgb strip, cooler master hyper 212x, 7200rpm wd hard drive, adata ssd, gaming mouse, keyboard, elgato external capture card, cannon printer, Asus 27 inch monitor, gigabyte ga-ax370m-ds3h motherboard. Great for gaming, streaming, video editing, everyday needs! Room for overclocking my system now that I upgraded from 450w originally in the system. - User from Amazon</li>
