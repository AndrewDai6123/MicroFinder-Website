                    <li>Install went well until connecting the modular "Perif" cable to the power supply. It would not clip into place and therefore continually loosen at the connection point. I did not check connection prior to the install (that's on me) so I had to pull the supply back out. Upon closer inspection of the connection point, one of the internal Electrolytic capacitors was leaned up against the internal connection, preventing the clip from catching. So I had to gently poke a toothpick at the opening and convince the capacitor to bend the other way. Now the cable fits securely into the power supply. It has been running well for about 5 days. 3-stars on install because the average layperson may not have figured out the problem. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Works totally fine, haven't had any troubles with the thing other than the smell it had when it came in. Don't know what it was, but it freaked me out at first. Thought it was some kind of burning even though it hadn't been plugged in at all. Wasn't anything burning, just some weird smell on it that mostly dissipated after a few brief uses. It's very quiet though. I don't have a whole lot to add for this other than it does its job, just smelled odd when it came in at first. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I originally bought this because of the good reviews and my previous experience with Corsair PC components. I can say, I'm not disappointed. The fully modular design allows just the cables I need to be plugged in, reducing potential disruptions in airflow caused by unnecessary cable clutter. The USB port on the PSU allows the device to plug into an internal USB 2.0 header and communicate with the CorsairLINK software, which allows me to monitor things like power consumption, power output, fan speed, PSU temperature, and calculated efficiency. Right now I'm sitting at 79.42% efficiency with jumps every so often up to 80ish%, with the fan spinning at 0 RPMs... Wait, what? Yes friends, this power supply is so smart that even its fan knows when to stop spinning... er, start spinning. The fan on this critter doesn't spin up until the PSU reaches a certain load level. That means you have one less fan spinning in your computer to make noise. Which is a good thing, because my computer sits on top of my desk, just to the right of my main monitor. The less I hear from it, the better. Don't worry about it not working though, there is a test button on the unit that will spin up the fan so you know it is still functional. My plans are to only use this with a single video card... Currently a GTX 970, and this PSU is providing plenty of power to keep everything up and running. Power wise, I've got the aforementioned video card, a i7 6700k (not over clocked at the moment,) 32GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR 4 RAM, a Corsair H100i GTX dual 120mm radiator water cooler, a Samsung 950 pro 256GB M.2 SSD, 2 Kingston 240GB SSDs in a RAID-0, a 4TB hybrid Seagate HDD, keyboard and mouse of course, and a USB wireless headset beaming music to me while I write this all plugged into an ASUS Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1 motherboard, and the CorsairLINK software is telling me I'm using only about 65 watts from the wall, with the occasional jumps up to just under 100 watts. This PSU is doing exactly what it's supposed to do and not whining about it (fan whine that is). - User from Amazon</li>
