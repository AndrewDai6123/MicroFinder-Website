                <h1>Reviews from Customers</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite the fairly high rating of this product, looking at the reviews shows a different story. People talking about how their unit was DOA or fried their motherboard, things like that. Anyone would be skeptical, right? On a budget, I didn't have too many options, so I bit the bullet and decided to take a chance with it. About 2 months in, and I've had no problems with it whatsoever. No noticeable fan noise, my motherboard hasn't exploded, no funny smells. Its a perfectly functioning PSU and I wholly recommend it despite the surplus of sketchy reviews. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>At $45 this was a steal. Running a 2600x with an Rx 570. I have a power meter showing ~235 watts at the wall with 3dmark running. I donâ€™t hear it running, everything is stable and excellent took a while to arrive, shipped from across the country. Worth it though. I notice price and availability fluctuations. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I purchased this as a replacement for a power supply that was damaged by power failure to my home. The length of cables on this power supply is more than adequate for virtually any computer. The quantity and type of plugs covers most everything plus add-ons. The noise level of the fan is EXTREMELY low! This is an excellent supply for the money and for the overall use on many different computers. VERY happy and the price was very reasonable. The unit has a 3 year warranty on it. Unheard of in this industry! - User from Amazon</li>
