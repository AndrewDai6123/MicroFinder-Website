                    <li>It works but I had issues installing it. I had to wiggle the cables and wires and push it in all the way hard to get it to work properly. I thought I bought a bad Power Station at first or bad motherboard but you just have to play with the wires / settings to get it to work properly you have to push very hard to get PSU cables to go in all the way, it took me 8 hours of trouble shooting and playing with it to figure out my wires weren't plugged in all the way. I was really close to sending it back but read some forums online and figured out that some people had same problems and they had to wiggle/ push wires in really hard to get it in all the way. So if you think you bought a defective unit it probably is just the wires need to be pushed all the way in properly and follow installation instructions. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>This thing is great. So far powering my Ryzen 5 3600, RTX 2070 (soon hope to get a 3080) on a gigabyte x570. I like the 0rpm mode, will increase the lifespan of the fan which is generally the first thing to start to go out (or at least get loud) in a computer. Set it to single-rail as I am afraid the 3080 may trip the 40amp max safety on the pci express rails even when there isn't' any electrical issues. I'm not an expert on electrical but that's what I've heard. So, single rail it is. Replaces my HX850W. Hoping this thing lasts me another 8+ years. No issues so far, will update if any issues. If no update, assume this thing is going strong still. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>Was skeptical at first because I read reviews. If you read any PSU reviews you'll notice all have some failures where it blows up your components, of course people complain about this. However I still took the precaution and attached it to an old system for several days running a heavy load. Everything was very stable and clean. The voltages don't jump around like the cheaper PSU's that I use to buy. I now have it installed into my new PC running higher end components. The GPU and CPU seem to be very stable and don't run out of power ever. The fan usually stays off when it doesn't need to cool its self. This is a nice feature since it wont get full of dust or create noise. I am curious to how this will affect its overall life however. Usually having electrical components warmer/hotter leads to shorter life. I'm sure they took that into consideration and have the temperature/fan settings appropriate. A few things I don't like however is the cables and this goes against most manufactures. They run the sleeve and heat-shrink right up to the connectors. This makes it very hard to bend or route cables nicely without putting considerable torque on the connectors. I know for one that I don't want a cable putting torque on an expensive GPU or my motherboard. This has the potential to break traces or solder connections on the boards. Back in the old days the wires were all free and they bent easier. I wish the PSU manufactures would make the ends more flexible. I was also somewhat confused on why the manufactures box had new stickers and such on it. I have seen this in retail stores and on Amazon now where this is sold by Corsair. The box was opened at some point and they have officially resealed it. They have changed the bar-codes and put new manufactures seals on the box. I really am curious to why. Did they replace the components, the user manual/documentation, or what? @Corsair - can you please tell me why? Or should I be concerned this isn't authentic? It looks very authentic like Corsair did this so I'm not sure what to think on this one. - User from Amazon</li>
