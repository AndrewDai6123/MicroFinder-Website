                <ul>
                    <li>Many folks overlook the value of the power supply unit (PSU). I cringe when I see nice expensive builds with over clocked CPU's, high end GPU's like 1070-1080tis and Vega's, lots of fans water cooling, RGB and the likes and then see a cheap no name or budget level PSU. Sure they saved a few bucks but they wonder why the overclock is not stable on the CPU or GPU or have random lock-ups and system reboots. Not all power supplies are created equal, not all power supplies can deliver their rated wattage and many even if they do can't do it cleanly with minimal ripple. I've used corsair PSU's exclusively for the past 20 years they are solid and deliver. Jon Gerow (Johnny Guru) works for Corsair as the head of QA at their power supply division. He knows what it takes to make a quality power supply and Corsair delivers! Clean, efficient and quiet and a 10 year warranty too boot! - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>MUST BUY! great for Crypto miners to run 24/7 everyday of the week with their 10+ 1080 ti rig config (2 PSU needed). The efficiency im getting running 10x 1080 ti is 93-94%. This PSU came out on January 2018 and has better tech then the typical EVGA Supernova 1600 which came out 2014 which was 4years ago. Its very quite! its compact, and they use GALLIUM NITRIDE for their transistors and everyone will follow suit. Voltage regulation is awesome through their corsair link. Along with the cords it comes with, if you know your not going to use 3 or 4 of the cords, you can sell them for $15+ each online to recoup some cost. But jokes a side, this is a great power supply, even if your not a crypto miner, this is by far one of the best PSU for gamers too, and everyone knows corsair products are top of the line. - User from Amazon</li>
                    <li>I originally bought this because of the good reviews and my previous experience with Corsair PC components. I can say, I'm not disappointed. The fully modular design allows just the cables I need to be plugged in, reducing potential disruptions in airflow caused by unnecessary cable clutter. The USB port on the PSU allows the device to plug into an internal USB 2.0 header and communicate with the CorsairLINK software, which allows me to monitor things like power consumption, power output, fan speed, PSU temperature, and calculated efficiency. Right now I'm sitting at 79.42% efficiency with jumps every so often up to 80ish%, with the fan spinning at 0 RPMs... Wait, what? Yes friends, this power supply is so smart that even its fan knows when to stop spinning... er, start spinning. The fan on this critter doesn't spin up until the PSU reaches a certain load level. That means you have one less fan spinning in your computer to make noise. Which is a good thing, because my computer sits on top of my desk, just to the right of my main monitor. The less I hear from it, the better. Don't worry about it not working though, there is a test button on the unit that will spin up the fan so you know it is still functional. My plans are to only use this with a single video card... Currently a GTX 970, and this PSU is providing plenty of power to keep everything up and running. Power wise, I've got the aforementioned video card, a i7 6700k (not over clocked at the moment,) 32GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR 4 RAM, a Corsair H100i GTX dual 120mm radiator water cooler, a Samsung 950 pro 256GB M.2 SSD, 2 Kingston 240GB SSDs in a RAID-0, a 4TB hybrid Seagate HDD, keyboard and mouse of course, and a USB wireless headset beaming music to me while I write this all plugged into an ASUS Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1 motherboard, and the CorsairLINK software is telling me I'm using only about 65 watts from the wall, with the occasional jumps up to just under 100 watts. This PSU is doing exactly what it's supposed to do and not whining about it (fan whine that is). - User from Amazon</li>
