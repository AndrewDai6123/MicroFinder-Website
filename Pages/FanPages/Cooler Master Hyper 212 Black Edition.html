                <ul>
                    <li>Be careful that the AMD mounting brackets are not interchangeable even though they look straight. At first I attached the left bracket to the right side of the cooler and the right bracket to the left side, and spent 40 mins trying to figure out why the four screws won't line up with the backing plate. Look at the included instructions carefully to figure out which bracket goes on which side. Once I figured out the mistake, installation was easy. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I bought this for a ryzen 5 3600 on a msi x570 apro stock oc and stock cooler, temps were around 83-90 on cod mw (I wouldn't even play it so I didn't hurt the cpu) and 79c on csgo. I got this and put it on and temps for cod mw are around 65 - 70c, csgo they are around 60 - 65c. long story short it helped more then what i thought from the impressions on fourms. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li> I have been using 212 series coolers for a long time and they are a go to for me. I don't seek max overclocks and don't need insane bling or to shave only one more degree C off peak load temps. Cooler Master has done an excellent job at maintaining this family of coolers at an excellent price and engineering to value aspect. I hope this continues for a very long time into the future. - User from Newegg</li>
