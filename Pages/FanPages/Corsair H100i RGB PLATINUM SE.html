                    <li>* Pay attention while hooking everything up! There are a lot of moving pieces here, and lots of things to plug in. I didn't have any problems, but if this is your first AIO water kit (which it was for me), definitely look over everything good and make sure you plug everything in. Luckily it is fairly easy to do but Corsair has great customer support if you have any issues. * After seeing the cooling performance, I wish I'd switched to a Corsair AIO water kit a long time ago! - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>First impressions, box looked pretty nice, I like the use of recycled materials for the inside packaging, don’t need too fancy stuff after the first glance at the packaging that will go into the trash/recycle bin at the end of the day(better that its made out of recyclable material). If you are doing a whole build, I recommend looking at the cases along with the water cooling system in mind at the same time. For me when I do upgrades. Water cooling is another world, this is such a pleasure to work with. There are 2 variables to consider besides the fans, that is water temp and pump duty cycle. I will say let the software do its thing with the duty cycle, and focus on water temp. The way I setup my quite system is run the apps that I normally run, watch the temps of the water, go back and tweak the fans to be working so that the water temp does not rise too much, then leave headroom for a benchmark like realbench, so the fans kick in and you do not go too high. I recommend using a mobo that has great config options for your fan headers, I did not really touch the Corsair software as the premium mobo fan header software does great job, and I was able to tweak everything I need that way, used few fan splitters and enough for whole case of fans. I did look at the software it is pretty configurable. I will say this about the Corsair software, they are improving things, I have lots of their products, and they seem to be headed into a good direction. I have been sold on water cooling systems for a while now, such as this H115i, so much so that I buy these for most of my systems, water does such a better job of absorbing those cpu spikes, and with some of these new high core count cpu’s you really need some serious cooling, even at stock speeds, and water cooling like the H115i deliver, otherwise if you go air expect your fans to spin up and down like a rollercoaster nonstop. I recommend this H115i series to just about anyone who knows how to build a system, if you buy with water cooling in mind then you will have a great experience for sure, and this RGB Platinum series is another step up aimed more so with premium parts and nice lighting. Is the price worth it? That all depends do you want performance and looks? Then yes, if you want plain performance at lower price point then no, go with any other plain vanilla H115i equivalent. - User from Newegg</li>
                    <li>I actually had a previous version of the hydro series. What was nice was that I could reuse the back plate mount so installation was a lot faster. The previous hydro, I could mount it to 6 points on my case, but unfortunately I could only align this to two points. It's still secure though. The previous hydro, on idle would keep my i7 6800k at 32C idle and 38C at load. This one keeps it at 26C idle and 32C at load. So there's a significant improvement there. Lights and cooler temps- what more can a PC gamer can ask for? It's nice to see Corsair improved on an already stellar product. I would highly recommend this cooler if you're looking for great performance and a little flair. - User from Newegg</li>
