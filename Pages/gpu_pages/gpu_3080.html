                    <li>It's a beast, everyone knows that. Runs everything i throw at it @1440p maxed out great, most AAA games near 100 fps or more. Only small tiny complaint would be the position of the 12 pin is just kind of odd but I've made it look as good as I can. But lets be real if its 2021 and you're reading this you don't read reviews about this card and then choose to buy it, the card chooses you if you are so lucky as to be able to actually purchase it. Don't forget to mine crypto while you're not using it or you're missing out on literally free money! - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>A beast of a GPU. Runs 4K games at high fps. I played Horizon Zero Dawn at 4K HDR with all settings at Ultra (except for Shadow and Cloud, which are High) and averages 80 fps. Thermals are decent. With a bit of undervolt (868@1920), I get average 60s and max 70C after long hours of gameplay. I'm sure the FE version is hotter than 3rd party AIB, but with the current stock and tariff issues, I can't be too picky. This GPU is currently powering my LG CX 48 OLED, and I'm very happy with the purchase. - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>The 3080 is THE graphics card of choice if you're looking for no compromise performance at a cost that is half of its upper tier brother the 3090. For about half the price, you'll get near identical real world performance. NVIDIA really stepped up their Founder's Edition cooling as well. Hard to say no to a GPU like this, especially if you manage to snag it at MSRP. With the way Best Buy has been handling the GPU shortage, buying from here is probably your best bet. Just make sure your tower can fit this thing in there, it is pretty large. - User from Best Buy</li>
