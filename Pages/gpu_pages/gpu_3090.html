                    <li>Fastest out. plays everything at 120+ FPS on ultra. raytracing fully enabled. overclocked to 2100. i might have to cap my FPS so my mind doesn't explode. i have the new xbox and ps5 and they became obsolete as soon as i paired the 3090 with 5900x...on the odyssey G9. there is no good "value" for anyone purchasing the 3090. dollar to frame its the worse card you can buy unless they release another titan in the future. This card was specifically intended for the true gangsters of gaming. if you don't light your cigarettes with flaming one hundred dollar bills on a daily basis, you might want to go with the 3080. but if you do choose the path of the elite you won't be sorry, i've never seen anything so beautiful in my life, aside from my girlfriend which i actually acquired only after her finding out i was a 3090 card owner. coincidence? - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>This card is definitely not for everyone. If your looking for the best at the moment in gaming or work editing applications and price to performance isn’t your concern than this is the card to get! AMD Big Navi is right around the corner at the time of writing this review so competition should be back which is great. If you need the high video memory for things like blender, rendering, Or want the best for gaming specifically with ray tracing this is it. AMD it’s your time now and very excited to see what you have in store! - User from Best Buy</li>
                    <li>After camping for months on Best Buy's site, and a lot of not making it thru checkout, I finally scored and no i didn't use a bot. Honestly its way more than I need. I really wanted a 3080 and would have settled for a 3070 but after using my old 1080 in my new rig crowned with a Ryzen 5800x I just didn't care and was happy to get a card at MSRP as I absolutely refuse to pay scalper scum and would have waited out this "shortage" otherwise. While pric The 3090 crushes all my games on ultra, practically zero bottleneck with my setup, though guess I'll have to upgrade from a 2k 144mhz monitor to a 4k to get full effect. While this purchase did not make my wife happy it certainly made my son happy as he received the 1080 to upgrade from a r9 380x. Oh you will need a case with plenty of room and a reinforced PCIE slot or a brace is recommended  as this thing IS HUGE! - User from Best Buy</li>
